[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HyeongminLEE/image-processing-tutorial/blob/main/week3/week3_practice.ipynb)

## Instructions

1. Click the **Open In Colab** button above.
2. Go to **File > Save a copy in Drive** to save it to your personal Google Drive.
3. Freely modify and run cells in the copied notebook to practice.
4. Complete all Exercises (write code **and run** every cell), then submit the notebook to e-class.

- You may freely modify cells outside of Exercises (only Exercises are graded).
- **Caution**: Redefining variables from earlier cells may break later Exercises.
