# Week 4: Noise & Edge Detection

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HyeongminLEE/image-processing-tutorial/blob/main/week4/week4_practice.ipynb)

## Instructions

1. Click the **Open In Colab** button above.
2. Go to **File > Save a copy in Drive** to save it to your personal Google Drive.
3. Freely modify and run cells in the copied notebook to practice.
4. Complete all Exercises (write code **and run** every cell), then submit the notebook to e-class.

- You may freely modify cells outside of Exercises (only Exercises are graded).
- **Caution**: Redefining variables from earlier cells may break later Exercises.

## Contents

1. Aliasing
2. Image Noise
3. Image Denoising
4. Quality Metrics
5. Edge Detection

## Exercises

- [ ] **Exercise 4.1** — Filter x Noise Type comparison (Gaussian filter vs Median filter on different noise types, PSNR)
- [ ] **Exercise 4.2** — Optimal Gaussian filter search (sweep sigma, plot PSNR)
- [ ] **Exercise 5.1** — Sobel gradient magnitude & direction visualization
- [ ] **Exercise 5.2** — Edge detection on noisy images (Sobel vs Laplacian vs LoG vs Canny)
- [ ] **Final Challenge** — Bilateral filter: edge-preserving denoising
